Negotiation is problem-solving with others, and typically involves more than just a one-off exchange. Remembering that negotiations happen inside long-term relationships is important. Research has shown that people who take fu- ture vision or long-term perspectives are more likely to act ethically and to build better relationships because they are considering the long-term consequences (Rogers & Bazerman, 2008). Ruining a relationship with a peer in your research group over one negotiation is going to cause a lot of pain in the long run. Remembering that your relationship with your peers may go on in perpetuity (even after you leave the research group) will help you to increase transparency, focus on building trust, and negotiate ethically and effectively.
