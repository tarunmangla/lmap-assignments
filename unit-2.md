# Leadership without Authority

Three components for intrinsic motivation
1. Autonomy – a sense of ownership and control over outcomes
2. Competence – a feeling of confidence in one’s own abilities
3. Relatedness – a sense of belonging, that this work provides value to others

**Active Listening**
Ask the right questions.
1. Diagnostic inquiry – evaluative questions, designed to steer the other person’s thinking in a particular direction and to evaluate the content of the answer
2. Confrontational inquiry – inserting one’s own perspective into the question, when the person asking their ques- tion inserts their own opinion into the question itself
3. Process-oriented inquiry – shifting the conversation to the conversation itself, an opportunity to ask if this conversation is the right type of conversation for this particular issue and including both parties in the process of deciding this
4. Humble inquiry – questions based in pure curiosity, accessing one’s own ignorance and actively removing bias from the question to gather as much knowledge from the other person as possible.
