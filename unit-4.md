Different types of people in a team:
1. Results-oriented – team members who are aware of and focused on the goal defined for the team and who facili- tate the organization of team processes to accomplish that goal.
2. Relationship-oriented – team members who are focused on the interpersonal dynamics among the team mem- bers, who know and understand the different types of people and their strengths and weaknesses, and who can motivate and encourage teamwork among them.
3. Process and rule followers – team members who focus on the steps needed to achieve the goal and can bring the team members back to the structure and rules in order to move toward the goal.
4. Innovative thinkers – team members who are thinking creatively and who are not bound by the rules, therefore are able to offer creative solutions to problems.
5. Pragmatists – team members who are aware of the constraints and limitations that inevitably face any group deci- sion-making task and can help to keep the group on track


People generally have different styles of managing conflict:
1. Competing – one party only seeks to achieve their own interests, regardless of impact to others.
2. Collaborating – parties are equally concerned about self and others; they search for shared interests.
3. Compromising – parties are equally concerned about self and others; they are thinking more distributively, such
that one party may give something up for the other.
4. Avoiding – parties show equally low concern for self and other, and therefore wish to suppress the conflict.
5. Accommodating – one party is more concerned with other than self, and may give up more than the other party.


One way to facilitate trust that leads to psychological safety is through an enhanced understanding of conversational intelligence (Glaser, 2016). Conversational intelligence refers to the quality of discussion among individuals. In teams, personal goals and team goals can conflict, and often, individuals are focused on preserving their own perspectives and opinions. When one person confronts another, and the perspectives clash, this can lead to a rise in cortisol, a stress hormone related to the flight-or-fight response. To reduce cortisol and to have more productive discussions that are inclusive of diverse perspectives, it is important to build skills for “dialoguing” (Bohm and Weinburg, 2004). Dialogue is a form of free-flowing conversation in which individuals seek to understand other points of view, instead of focusing on defending their own position.


Team formation phase:
1. Forming Phase – This is the stage when teams form and get to know each other. Team members set goals, learn about each other’s personalities and working styles, and organize plans. During this phase, leaders assign tasks and responsibilities, and ideally, solicit feedback from the group.
2. Storming Phase – During the storming phase, interpersonal challenges arise and conflicts occur. When teams do not fully know how to work together, miscommunications happen, and unforeseen personality misalignments can occur. Team members are also discovering their differences and can feel ostracized through subtle acts of exclusion, such as through microaggressions (Hu-Chan 2020). Conflicts can also occur from misaligned expectations, or setting unrealistic goals that impact performance. Team performance usually takes a dip during this phase until these issues get addressed.
3. Norming Phase – The norming phase is a time for reflection and recalibration. The team welcomes feedback from each other. They establish more realistic goals, set boundaries and expectations, and establish behavioral norms for inclusivity. It is important during this phase to make space for team feedback.
4. Performing Phase – During the performing phase, teams are aligned, meeting their goals and working well togeth- er. Teams set manageable milestones, and celebrate successes. Conflicts can still occur, but team members wel- come differences of perspective, and provide each other with constructive and respectful feedback. Team members also understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and can complement each other skills. This is an opportu- nity for team members to learn from each other, and to grow personally and professionally.
